  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="WEB specification">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform. It was originally a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet.
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>

HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
